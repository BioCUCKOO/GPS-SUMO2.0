# GPS-SUMO 2.0
Sumoylation is an essential post-translational modification that regulates predominantly nuclear processes, including transcription, DNA damage, RNA processing, cell cycle, nuclear body formation and proteostasis. Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) can be attached to target proteins covalently at sumoylation sites. SUMO-modified proteins can be recognized by non-covalent readers via SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs).
Here, we developed GPS-SUMO 2.0, a small ubiquitination modification prediction tool updated from SUMOsp, SUMOsp 2.0 and GPS-SUMO. From the scientific literature and database, we manually collected 58,503 sumoylation sites in 11,705 proteins and 176 known SIMs in 104 proteins across 13 species which is at least 3.5 times of the other existing tools, then integrated 11 types of sequence and structure features as well as Transformer algorithm to improve the accuracy of prediction. We also provided the source of predicted sites and PPI information from 28 databases. For convenience, we updated options allowing users to predict with protein sequence or identifiers on specific species with optional models. For presentation, the visualization of accessible surface area and disorder propensity, the PPI information, the sequence WebLogo, 3D structures and links to PTM databases were added.
